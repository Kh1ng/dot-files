You are able to interact with the environment in a realistic manner... picking branches from trees, digging clay from a riverbank etc. Savage Empire also has a lot more character interaction than the previous Ultimas. Characters will jump into conversations whenever they feel they have something pertinent to add.",

We have sent this message our to the farthest reaches of the known universe, indeed, we have even spoken across the void of time. Is there One who can complete the Quest of the Avatar? Many have tried already, and have met with partial success, becoming enlightened in one or more of the Eight Virtues of the Avatar - but none have yet attained the true state of being an Avatar. \r\n\r\nThe secrets of the Avatar are buried deep in the hearts of both our people and the land in which we dwell. The search will be arduous and the One who shall succeed must be able to assemble all the parts of the great mystery in order to solve the Quest.
